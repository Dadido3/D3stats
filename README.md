# D3stats

A simple addon managing map statistics and player levels.

- It outputs statistics about the win ratio of a map at the begging of a round
- It gives the players a level, XP and permission to use or buy the hammer
- XP is earned by gaining pointshop points as human or by killing humans as zombie
- Player levels increase after gathering a certain amount of XP
- Permissions are given after a specific level is reached
- All those things are freely configurable

## State

It works, but the addon is not finished, and probably will not be finished in the forseeable future.

## Usage

- Create a folder called `d3stats` inside of your addon folder of your Garry's Mod server
- Copy files by either:
  - Clone the repository inside the created folder
  - If you download the repository as zip, move the **content** of `D3bot-master` inside the created folder
- You should get a folder structure like: `.../garrysmod/addons/d3stats/lua`
- You can change settings as you wish inside of `.../garrysmod/addons/d3stats/lua/d3stats/sh_settings.lua"`
- Done
